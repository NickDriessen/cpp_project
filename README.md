# 

* # Basis



1. # useful and correct class (explain why)
2. # useful and correct abstraction (explain why)
3. # useful and correct encapsulation (explain why)
4. # useful and correct inheritance (explain why)
5. # useful and correct polymorphism (explain why)
6. # useful and correct object composition (explain why)
7. # useful and correct base class
8. # useful and correct abstract base class
9. # useful and correct virtual function
10. # no mistake in object-oriented programming
11. # Aanvullend

# 

* # Algemeen



1. # clean main (i.e. nothing in the main that should be in a class)
2. # no globals, but statics if needed
3. # correct protections
4. # maintainability by clean uniform code style and good function naming and/or comments everywhere
5. # separate header files
6. # one complete project that compiles and does not crash
7. # fully working project
8. # sufficient git commits (+/- weekly)
9. # correct files on git
10. # working build manual as readme on GitHub (project must be possible to build from scratch on a clean PC)

# 

* # OOP



1. # at least 2 default constructors
2. # at least 2 parameterized constructors
3. # at least 2 copy constructors
4. # at least 2 destructors
5. # member initialization in constructors (the stuff behind a colon)
6. # constructor forwarding
7. # useful proven (dynamic) polymorphism
8. # useful usage of "this" (if the code does not work without it)
9. # useful member function
10. # default values in function definition
11. # useful member variabel
12. # useful getters and setters for member variables
13. # correct usage of inline function
14. # useful template function or class
15. # useful friend function or class





* # C++



1. # everything in one or more self-made namespace(s)
2. # 2 useful unsigned chars or other better usage of memory efficient type
3. # at least 4 useful const references for variables
4. # at least 4 useful const references for functions
5. # at least 4 useful bool
6. # dynamic memory allocation (new)
7. # dynamic memory removing (delete)
8. # 2 useful (modern) call-by-references
9. # useful string class usage
10. # useful container class
11. # useful usage of nullptr
12. # useful usage of (modern) file-I/O
13. # useful exception handling
14. # useful usage of lambda function
15. # useful usage of threads





* # Uitbreiding



1. # useful Qt class
2. # useful usage of signals/slots
3. # test-driven development (= written test plan or unit tests)
4. # solve bug ticket (with pull request or commit message issue link and issue branch)
5. # report a bug ticket on another project
6. # usage of a GUI
7. # usage of OpenGL or other 3D engine
8. # useful usage of an external library (not Qt)
9. # project that communicates (e.g. UART, BT) with hardware
10. # a nice extra that you think that should deserve grading (stuff you put time in and is not rewarded by an item above)
